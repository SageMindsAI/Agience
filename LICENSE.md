This repository contains various types of content, each covered by different licenses as described below. The **core software** is available under a **dual-license model**: a combination of the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)** and a **commercial license** for specific use cases.

## Core Software (Dual License: AGPL-3.0 and Commercial)

### AGPL-3.0 License

The core software in **a `/src` directory** is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)**. This license allows for:

- **Open-Source Use**: You may copy, modify, and distribute the software, provided any public use over a network ensures that the modified source code is also made available under the AGPL-3.0.
- **Private Modifications**: You may make modifications and use the software privately, without sharing the source code, as long as it is not made publicly accessible over a network.

A full copy of the AGPL-3.0 license can be found in the `LICENSE-AGPL-3.0.txt` file.

### Commercial License

For commercial entities, enterprises, or those seeking to make proprietary modifications without making the source code publicly available, a commercial license is required. The commercial license applies under the following conditions:

- **Revenue Cap**: If your organization exceeds **$1M USD in revenue**, you are required to obtain a commercial license.
- **Private Use for Corporations**: If you are making proprietary modifications to the software and do not intend to share the modifications publicly, you must obtain a commercial license.
- **Redistribution**: If you redistribute the software as part of a proprietary service or product, a commercial license is required.
- **Non-Profit and Educational Use**: Non-profit organizations and educational institutions may use the core software under the AGPL-3.0 without a commercial license.

## RFC Proposal License

The IETF RFC proposal drafts in **a `/drafts` directory** are subject to the **IETF Trust's Legal Provisions Relating to IETF Documents**. The documents are submitted as Internet-Drafts and are part of the IETF's contribution process. You may freely copy and redistribute the draft for review and comment, but they are provided "as-is" without warranties.

For further details, refer to the [IETF Trust Legal Provisions](https://trustee.ietf.org/license-info/).

## Unspecified Code and Content

Any code or content outside the defined directories (e.g., `/src`, `/samples`, `/docs`, `/ietf-drafts`) defaults to the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)** unless otherwise explicitly stated. This ensures that any undefined components of the project remain under a default license that is consistent with the core.
